# markov-bot

This is my feeble attempt to create a twitter bot based on markov chains.
Things I'd like to do:
- get tweets to build a corpus
- store the tweets in a SQLite DB
- build out markov chains using `markovify`
- send said tweets into the interwebs!

I'm hoping this can be a all in one package that others can fork and reuse
for their own entertainment (please don't harass others!)
